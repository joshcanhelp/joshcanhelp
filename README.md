# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

**Thanks for checking me out!**

I do a lot of things here on GitHub, some of which you can see in my pinned repos below. You can reach me using the links above (on mobile) or to the left (on desktop). [All of my blog posts are here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/posts/) and [what I write about is here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/tags/).

**Update on using AI:** I have GitHub Copilot installed in VS Code and have been evaluating it while working on personal projects. I have found it somewhat useful for 1-2 line changes, similar to code completion in an IDE. For any project that uses AI regularly I will add an `AI.md` file to the repository. [More complete thoughts here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/ai/).
