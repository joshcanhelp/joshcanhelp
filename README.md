# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

**Thanks for checking me out!**

I am currently looking for the next thing in my professional life. [You can read about that here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/hire-me/). 

I do a lot of things here on GitHub, some of which you can see in my pinned repos below. You can reach me using the links above (on mobile) or to the left (on desktop). [All of my blog posts are here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/posts/) and [what I write about is here](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/tags/).

AI is an amazing tool and I use it to learn new things and explore new technology but **I have no AI-written code committed to any of the repos I own.**. If this changes, you'll see a notice on the repo itself and this message will change.
